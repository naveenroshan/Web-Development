        <p>A blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web
            consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in
            reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until
            2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual,[citation needed] occasionally of a small group,
            and often covered a single subject or topic</p>
        <p>aThe rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the
            news media. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.<a

        <p>In the 2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes
            professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy
            groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic.</p>
        <p> In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers do not only
            produce content to post on their blogs, but also often build social relations with their readers and other
            bloggers.[3] However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.<a href="#">here</a></p>
